# spacewar-plus
A simple spacewar remake written in python, using Godot Engine.

I do not own any of the tracks used in this project. Specifically, the Title Theme, BGM and Victory Theme come from 3 different games. 
Title theme: [A dream that is more scarlet than red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZepIG-nl9k), made by Theodore M., original song from Touhou 6, by ZUN
BGM: Bentley comes through, from Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus, owned by Sony and Sucker Punch
Victory Theme: Victory Fanfare, from Final Fantasy XVII, owned by Square Enix
